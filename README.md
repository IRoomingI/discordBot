# Discord Bot

This is a bot written in Python with help of the [discord.py API](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py "discord.py Github Page").

**Important!** You should know how to create and set up a Discord bot

Packages you need to run the bot:

* Python 3.5 or higher [[Download](https://python.org/downloads/ "Python Download")]

* discord.py package for Python (look at [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py "discord.py Github Page") GitHub for installation info)

* asyncio package for Python `python3 -m pip install -U asyncio`

* colorama package for Python (colored commandline output) `python3 -m pip install -U colorama`

## Please Read

Please don't think that this project will reach huge scales, like other bots coded by people much more talented than I am.
This is project was started for fun and I can't promise frequent updates.

## Installation

* Clone or Download this repository to any place (I recommend a place you'll remember ;D)

* Enter the folder and configure the _CONFIG.json_

    ```json
    "TOKEN" : "0123456789abcdefg"   (example Token)
    "PREFIX" : "COMMAND_PREFIX"     (default is "+")
    "OWNER_ID" : "22234234354326"   (your discord user id)
    "GAME" : "a game"               (game that the bot plays)
    ```

* Execute the _main.py_ `python3 main.py`

* **or** use the _start.sh_ if you are on Linux `sh start.sh` (make sure you are in the same folder and have _screen_ installed)

* That's all, now the bot should be running
